[Notes](https://projects.100xdevs.com/tracks/docker-2)

so why docker ?

> like if you want to work with a technology like node.js
but it is os specific when you want to ship your application and if you ship then it will be os independent environment

Image --> 
In Docker, an image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that contains everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, dependencies, and configuration files. Images are the building blocks of containers.


so when you containerize the application and you want to avail using docker cli and you connect to the docker engine and docker engine connects to the docker registory , now docker engine has the 

docker clli --> docker engine/runtime(which you install locally) --> docker registory

> so you create a dockerfile to create a image 

**running docker image is the docker container**
